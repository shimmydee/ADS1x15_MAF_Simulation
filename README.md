# ADS1x15_MAF_Simulation
This repository is for the Python simulation of a moving average filter (MAF) at the empirically observed Adafruit ADS1x15 sampling rates determined on a Canberra HPGE DMA300 at the Heavy Ion Accelerator Facility at the Australian National University.

Simply change the input parameters to suit the particular DSP setup. This tool can be used to explore tradeoffs between sampling rate of the ADC to the MAF's accuracy under different signal conditions. Generates a matplotlib plot.
